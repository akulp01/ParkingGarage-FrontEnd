# License Plate Recognition System (Frontend)

This project is a fully functional Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) system that enables monitoring and tracking of vehicles entering a designated area. The system operates by receiving requests from a backend server and logging the entering and exiting vehicles. In addition, it provides tables of cars and permits obtained from a backend SQL database and offers search functionality to the user based on a multitude of variables.

## Features

- Displaying tables retrieved from a backend SQL database to provide the user with useful insights on the system's data.
- Receiving post requests of entering and exiting vehicles and displaying the logs to the user. This functionality is useful for keeping track of the traffic in the designated area.
- Offering search functionality to the user based on various variables such as the vehicle's license plate number or driver's name. This makes it easy for the user to quickly find the information they need.
